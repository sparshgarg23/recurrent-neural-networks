# recurrent-neural-networks
A current ongoing work that covers the basics of recurrent neural networks and work done in coursera course Sequence Models.
The first project helps us  to understand the concepts related to LSTM and how deep learning can be used to generate music.
The second concept deals with implementation nuances of a RNN.The thing that makes an RNN special is its ability to remember information that gets passed through the layers one time step at a time.
There are two versions one that takes info from the past to process inputs at later stage and the second has the capability to process inputs by using the past and future information.
